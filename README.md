The **AI Dev Assistant Framework** provides a structured governance framework designed for AI-assisted software development. This framework transforms any AI coding assistant into a reliable, context-aware engineering partner. By establishing clear protocols, it enhances collaboration between human developers and AI tools, ensuring that software development remains efficient and effective.

## Features

- **Context Awareness**: AI assistants adapt to the specific needs of projects.
- **Structured Protocols**: Clear guidelines for interaction with AI tools.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Improve teamwork between developers and AI.
- **Flexibility**: Works with various AI coding assistants.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for projects of all sizes.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MunnaXbadmash/ai-dev-assistant-framework/releases). 

1. Navigate to the releases page.
2. Download the appropriate file for your operating system.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided in the downloaded package.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the framework in your development projects. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to integrate the framework with your AI coding assistant:
